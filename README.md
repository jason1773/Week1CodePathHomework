Week1 Code Path Homework

This took me about 5.5 hours. As of mid day sunday. I'm pushing now incase I can't work moe on it tomorrow. 

 

I left a mistake in that I want to ask about, its the newly created account sign out dropping the user back on the view terms screen.

Seems like there could be a outline diagram of how to build the flows or something. Because the double nav view controllers feels wrong in this. 


## Dropbox

The purpose of this homework is to use Xcode to implement the flow between the screens of an application. We're going to use the techniques from this week to implement the Dropbox app from the signed out state to the basic signed in state.

Time spent: This took me about 5.5 hours. As of mid day sunday. I'm pushing now incase I can't work moe on it tomorrow.
